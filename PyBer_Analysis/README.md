# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
  -In this project I used a combination of Matplotlib, Python, pandas and NumPy to create a detailed summary about ride share data information.
  -I then made a multi-line graph to represent the total weekly fares for different city types (Rural, Urban and Suburban).
  
## Results
  -From the multi-line graph I was able to find that all three cities are steady through the year and do not rise and fall too dramatically. 
  
  There are some thigns to note here:
  1. Urban cities make the most than Suburban and Rural cities. That is expected since business, points of interest and restaurants are closer to each other as well as     their riders. This means more trips per driver and shorter distances riders and their destinations. With more drivers in this general area there are shorter times to     request a driver but that in turn means drivers have a lower fare per ride. 
  
  2. Rural cities have the least amount of total rides out of the city types. This is to be expected since there are fewer drivers and they are more spread out in remote   areas. While this may be the case, rural drivers earn more per ride than their Urban counterparts. This could be because rural trips are longer and in turn are more     than ones with a shorter distance like in the city.
