# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
I used a combination of Matplotlib, Python, NumPy, and Pandas functions to take a deep dive into ride share data for different city types.
I also created a multi line chart to show my findings.

## Results
After inspecting the data and creating data sets I found that the Urban city type generates the most amount of fares and the rural generates the least amount. Suburban neatly in the middle of them cruising along. This could be because there are more people and drivers in the city, as well as their destinations being close together. That means more but shorter rides per driver. In the rural city types the opposite occurs. There are less rides and less drivers, but this in turn generates a higher fare average per ride for Rural drivers. 

This is represented in the table below:

## Summary
Based on these findings I recommend these actions to the CEO of PyBer:

1. Keep generating as much traffic and maintain a relvant presence in the Urban city. Clearly this is where the highest revenue is generated and it can be consistent throughout the year. Offeringn promotions or going to a subscription model to attract new and existing passengers to use the app when they are in the city of travel to another area. 
2. Do not pay too much attention to the Suburban city type. Business is operating at a steady stream here and it appears that passengers are using the application regardless of driver availability or price of fare. 
3. Invest more resources in Rural areas that will attract more customers and drivers. Since tehse are where longer trips occur, it would be wise to use this area to its maximum advantage.
